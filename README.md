# Treewidth support for BGL

## Project structure
All the source files of the project are located in folder ```src/```. Tests for source files are in folder ```test/```. Example of usage is located in file ```example/example.cpp```. Documentation of public interface of functions is generated by **Doxygen** and it's located in ```doc/index.html```. Lastly, thesis is in folder ```thesis/``` both in LaTeX and PDF format.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler **g++** installed (tested on c++14 version, however c++11 should suffice) and **GNU Make**.
2. Install the Boost Library:
```console
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
```
3. If you want to display **.dot** files (text representation of graphs created by this example) in more user-friendly form, install the graphviz library which converts **.dot** files into a PNG:
```console
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

## Usage
1. Example of usage is located in ```example/example.cpp``` - edit this file if you want to use different graphs. If the variable ```SAVE_GRAPHS``` is set to *true*, **.dot** and **.png** files with graphs will be created in ```example/```. If the variable is set to *false*, graphs will be instead output to stdout.

2. To run this example use the **make** command in the root of this project:
```console
make run
```
If you have **graphviz** installed, the command will create **.png** files with graphs representing the arbitrary and nice decompositions. If you don't, you can instead paste the content of **.dot** files into online graphviz interpreter (for example [Webgraphwiz.com](http://www.webgraphviz.com/)).

3. To run tests use following **make** command:
```console
make test
```

4. To display all defined **make** commands, use:
 ```console
make help
```
